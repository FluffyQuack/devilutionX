# Info and stuffs:
 - This is a fork of the [DevilutionX repo](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX)
 - I'm doing my work in the FluffyMod branch. The branch is based on the v1.1.0 code of DevilutionX

# Features:
 - Fast walk in town (can be toggled via "Fast Walking In Town" config variable)
 - Attacking and casting spells are allowed actions in town (can be toggled via "Allow Attacks In Town" config variable)
 - High resoluotion timer for timing related functions
 - Support for loading stock Diablo savegames (savegames saved via FluffyMod can't be loaded by stock Diablo, though)
